# DnDCharacter
DnD character info scraper

You will need to have requests, json, and math installed to be imported for this project.


This program will pull down my character data from D&D Beyond website and make it available for other programs 
    such as a dice roller, or damage calculator, or for viewing. I plan on makeing the code work with any D&D Beyond
    character with a user input of the character number from D&D Beyond. 


The fetures I have implemented in my project are:
    -Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data
    -Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
    -Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
    -Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used
    -Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app (not sure if this one counts)
    -Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data(not implemented yet)
    -Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper
        that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page(not sure if this one counts as the webpage accessed is json)
