# DnDCharacter
<h2>DnD character info scraper</h2>

<p>You will need to have requests, json, and math installed to be imported for this project.</p>
<p><li>pip install requests</li>
    <li>json is a built in module</li>
    <li>math is a built in module</li>


<p>This program will pull down my character data from D&D Beyond website and make it available for other programs 
    such as a dice roller, or damage calculator, or for viewing. I plan on makeing the code work with any D&D Beyond
    character with a user input of the character number from D&D Beyond.</p> 


<p>The features I have implemented in my project are:
    <li>Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data</li>
    <li>Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program</li>
    <li>Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application</li>
    <li>Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used</li>
    <li>Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app (not sure if this one counts)</li>
    <li>Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data</li>
    <li>Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper
        that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page(not sure if this one counts as the webpage accessed is json)</li></p>
